<h1>Unilever's TV Mastersheet: Streamlining TV Campaign Performance Analysis </h1>

Mindshare Unilever Media Team utilizes the "TV Mastersheet" to analyze the performance of its TV advertising campaigns across various product categories like Homecare, Skin Care, and Food. This automated system drastically reduces the time and effort required for analysis, providing valuable insights to teams within minutes.

Data Consolidation: Monthly post-campaign data, including reach and spending details, are extracted from various sources and loaded into a MySQL database.
Metric Calculation: The system then uses pre-defined queries to calculate a comprehensive set of performance metrics. These include:
Overall Performance: Total spends, Net Rating Points (NGRPs), Share of Voice (SOV), Share of Spending (SOS), and Cost Per Rating Point (CPRP).
Brand-Specific Performance: Metrics similar to the above, but broken down by individual brands and further segmented by factors like TV channel genre (News, Entertainment, Sports), and time of day (Morning, Afternoon).
Unified View: The TV Mastersheet consolidates all these metrics into a single, easily accessible report.


Benefits:

Time Savings: What used to take hours of manual effort for a single brand's monthly data can now be generated for an entire product category (multiple brands) across a whole year in minutes.
Data-Driven Insights: The comprehensive and readily available data enables the team to quickly identify correlations and trends, allowing for more informed decision-making in future campaigns.
Improved Collaboration: The centralized nature of the TV Mastersheet makes it easy for different teams within Unilever to access and analyze the data, fostering better collaboration and understanding of campaign performance.


This consolidated data is then integrated into a PowerBI dashboard, allowing users to visually explore these relationships and gain deeper insights into the performance of Unilever brands and its competitors.
